		<name>Cu-On-Pa SFC</name>
		<desc>Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.Ken Kojima was the music composer.</desc>

Many adventurers have tried to find their way to the mysterious land of the Golden Condor, but how many of them have survived the impassable mountain paths, the dark forests and caves, and the vicious monsters? You are the wanderer Shiren, and the goal of your life is to find the Golden Land. Together with your best buddy Koppa, a talking weasel, you decide to venture deep into the dungeons that lead to the land, and to try your luck there.  Furai no Shiren (The Wanderer Shiren) is a roguelike, hack-and-slash game with randomly generated dungeon areas, items, and monsters.

The dungeons are full of various traps and monsters, and sometimes non-playable characters you can talk to, some of which can join you on your quest. </desc>

		<desc>Galaxy Robo is a sci-fi strategy game from Copya System and Imagineer. The player directs a group of mech pilots, each riding distinctive bi-pedal suits and other vehicles. The game is structurally similar to Fire Emblem: the player moves all their units for their turn, either fighting enemy units or performing other tasks, and then control switches to the opponent. When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused.  The game was a Japanese exclusive. It was one of a handful of games to use the SNES Mouse peripheral.</desc>

		<desc>Mais uma vez, Tenshi está trabalhando duro para encontrar uma maneira de matar Ackman para sempre. Mas, o que é isso, parece que houve um abalo na cadeia de comando, e agora Tenshi é procurado pela Polícia Angel! Tenshi será capaz de limpar seu bom nome? Quem está realmente puxando as cordas aqui? E, o mais importante, Ackman se importa com tudo isso?    O último dos jogos da série Ackman, Go Go Ackman 3, faz poucas mudanças em relação a Go Go Ackman 2, embora Tenshi agora seja um personagem jogável. Ackman e Tenshi podem ser alternados em pontos especiais de um nível, mas eles compartilham o mesmo medidor de vida e arma. Ao contrário de Ackman, Tenshi pode voar, mas como ele é um anjo, não pode coletar as almas dos inimigos que mata. As almas também mudaram e agora são usadas como moeda em lojas onde Ackman pode comprar reforços temporários ou curas. Finalmente, Ackman perdeu a capacidade de deslizar os inimigos pelo chão, mas agora ele pode se mover enquanto segura um inimigo atordoado.</desc>

Instead it focuses on the cartoonish, comedic situations Gon gets himself into, particularly when searching for food and interacting with other animals. Gon would venture into different ecosystems that made up the prehistoric world.</desc>

		<desc>In Gourmet Sentai: Bara Yarou the player picks from three characters: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien. Each has slightly different movesets to use on downed or stunned opponents, but each posses the punch, throw, and jump usual for belt-scrolling brawlers. The characters must get past several minor enemies on each level before fighting a stronger boss at the end. Each enemy will drop a cooking ingredient when defeated, and at the end of each level two ingredients can be combined to make a meal that will restore some health based on if the chosen character likes it or not. Environments range from slums and palaces to high speed trains and space ships, but in general there is not much continuity between different areas.</desc>

		<desc>In Violinist of Hameln you play the role of Hamel, a sort of wanderer / adventurer whose weapon is… a violin. His music can cover enemies in fear, or even control their minds. Hamel and his mascot Oboe arrives at Staccato, a small town attacked by monsters, and drives them away with his power. Impressed, a cute little girl named Flute decides to go with Hamel in order to find and destroy the evil power behind the attacks.  The game is typical platform. You play as Hamel, and with your violin can shoot musical notes to beat your enemies. However, you count with Flute’s aid. Flute follows you (although you can order her to stop and stay), but also can be grabbed and thrown at the enemies (yes, thrown at the enemies). Flute can also collect through all the stages some costumes that, when worn, give her special abilities, such as flying, leaping, breaking walls or even explode and kill all in screen. At the end of each stage, of course, you’ll find the typical boss, all named as musical instruments. </desc>

A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."  The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.  Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat. </desc>

		<desc>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.  In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.  To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</desc>

		<desc>May is an apprentice mage at Magic School and must pass the final exam.  A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.  As the game progresses, levels become increasingly difficult and new hazards and enemies are introduced. Enemies follow a set movement pattern and can sometimes be stopped, but not destroyed by magic bubbles. Later levels are made more complicated by different types of tiles including: grass that slows down May, ice that May and the magic stone will slip over, spikes that destroy the stone if it is pushed into them, collapsing tiles that can only be walked over once, rune tiles on which May cannot create magic bubbles, teleporters and others.</desc>

		<name>Psycho Dream</name>
		<desc>Psycho Dream is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, similar in style to Valis games, though less story-driven. The game is set in predominantly modern-day environments. The player can choose to control either Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl named Sayaka and rid the world of rampaging monsters. The two protagonists share the same stages; only single-player mode is available.nnnnBoth demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.</desc>

Ainda conta com as licenças da FOCA e da Fuji Television, duas organizações que controlam os direitos de licenciamento da Fórmula 1 no Japão. O jogo é vagamente inspirado por Super Mario Kart e seus imitadores. O jogo mostra o percurso por trás do veículo do jogador, com a segunda metade da tela ocupada pelo segundo jogador humano (se aplicável) ou um mapa geral do percurso e o progresso de todos os competidores. Incomparável para um carrinho de corrida, o SD F-1 Grand Prix permite que o jogador ganhe dinheiro com base em sua classificação e use esse dinheiro para atualizar seu veículo entre as corridas.</desc>

		<desc>?In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</desc>

		<name>Sutte Hakkun</name>
		<desc>Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks â€” that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then â€” and sucking potions â€” that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid â€” from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.    Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually.</desc>

It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!  "Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

		<name>The Great Battle Gaiden 2 : Matsuri da Wasshoi</name>
		<desc>The Great Battle Gaiden 2: Matsuri da Wasshoi (Matsuri refers to a Japanese festival, at which "wasshoi" is regularly chanted) is an off-beat "gaiden" (side story) game in The Great Battle sub-franchise: the flagship games of the Compati Hero Series. The game is based around an alien invasion during a festival, and the four heroes (Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Knight Gundam from Gundam and Fighter Roar, a character created for The Great Battle series).    The game has a mix of genres. The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos.    The Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the Great Battle series for Super Famicom which began with SD Great Battle in 1990.

This was so the immensely tall Gundam and Ultraman characters could fight alongside human-sized Kamen Rider characters.    Last Fighter Twin departs from SD Great Battle's top-down action gameplay with a side-scrolling brawler format.</desc>

		<name>Youkai Buster : Ruka no Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Game developers Sting' were contracted by the publishing comglomerate Kadokawa Shoten for a tie-in game for their gaming magazine Marukatsu Super Famicom, which had recently just started pushing a new mascot named Ruka (with an accompanying mini manga in each issue) to try and help boost sales of the magazine. Rather than create a new game from scratch, Sting opted to re-brand the already existing "The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates" game they had released the year before, which had not been released in Japan. The gameplay and level design between the two games is ultimately the same, though the story, sprites, and artwork were completely redone, as well as music.nnnnRuka-chan was a fiesty teenage-looking demon girl that was actually over 1000 years old. Her task was to rid the world of demons and monsters that were causing more trouble than she was. Ruka's boss Enma, the Buddhist deity charged with judging the souls of the dead - an Asian St. Peter, as it were - is represented as a giant red oni in a business suit and jokingly referred to by Ruka as "Elvis". One night his body was stolen by a handsome boy known only as, well, "Body" to be used for nefarious purposes along with his army of monsters. Left with only his head, Enma scolds and demands Ruka to get his body back or else he'll gladly take hers as a replacement.</desc>
